                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p>
                        A little about myself is that  during high school, I was like every other student and went to college for general education. Shortly before I graduated high school however,
                        I became interested in computer science. So in addition to taking general education classes, I also took computer science courses. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, I eventually came to feel that college is just a big scam when it comes to costs and the time to complete it, so I stopped taking classes and eventually
                        settled on taking a bootcamp to learn valuable skills related to the field that I want to enter.

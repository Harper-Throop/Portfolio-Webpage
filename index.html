                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p> <!-- How I became interested in computer science and software engineering -->
                        A little about myself is that  during high school, I was like every other student and went to college for general education. Shortly before I graduated high school however,
                        I became interested in computer science. So in addition to taking general education classes, I also took computer science courses. 
                    </p>

                    <p> <!-- My interest in working with others in software engineering -->
                        I joined the Thinkful bootcamp because I wanted to accelerate my growth as a software engineer and I'm eager to learn and work with
                        others. If you'd like to work with me, please feel free to contact me anytime!
